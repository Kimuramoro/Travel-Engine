# Travel-Engine
# This was my final project for IST256 at Syracuse University. 
#This is a search sengine for travel destination. The user enters a keyword/phrase and the program will return locations related to that keyword. 
#For example Skiing returns Canada, Norway, and Switzerland. The program also returns confidence for the accuracy of the returned results.
